## 8. Boundary

This report evaluates public PoR artifacts and reproducibility. It does not evaluate the exchange's overall financial health, corporate governance, internal controls, off-chain assets, legal compliance, or complete off-balance-sheet liabilities.

Missing data must be marked as `UNVERIFIABLE`, not treated as `PASS`.
