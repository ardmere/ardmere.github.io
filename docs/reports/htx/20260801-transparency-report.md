htx snapshot 20260801 remains Stage 0 in the ardmere public evaluation set.

Public artifacts do not support independently reproducible global solvency verification for this snapshot.

## 5. Verifier Evidence

| Verifier | Version | Verdict | Coverage | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact-integrity` | `1.0` | `PASS` | `1.0000` |  |
| `solvency-claim` | `1.0` | `FAIL` | `1.0000` | gate summary missing totalReserveRate |
| `global-zk-proof` | `htx-1` | `UNVERIFIABLE` | `0.0000` | HTX public-data zk bundle not present; download from PoR Reports or GitHub release public-data.zip |
| `internal-consistency` | `0` | `UNVERIFIABLE` | `0.0000` | No public wallet address CSV; cannot reconcile summary vs address aggregates |
| `btc-anchor` | `0` | `UNVERIFIABLE` | `0.0000` | Summary does not declare a BTC block height time anchor |

| `cross-chain-wrapped` | `0` | `UNVERIFIABLE` | `0.0000` | No per-row wrapped-asset metadata in public PoR artifacts (token contract, representation type e.g. WBTC/cbBTC, canonical asset, custody mode) |

## 6. Verifier Finding Details

This section explains `FAIL`, `WARN`, and `UNVERIFIABLE` outcomes from the verification bundle. Row-level `UNVERIFIABLE` entries often mean the verifier does not yet support that (coin, network) pair, not that the exchange failed the check. Full machine-readable output: `20260801.verification-bundle.v2.json` in the local artifact bundle.

### Capability and artifact gaps (`UNVERIFIABLE`)

| Verifier | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `global-zk-proof` | HTX public-data zk bundle not present; download from PoR Reports or GitHub release public-data.zip |
| `internal-consistency` | No public wallet address CSV; cannot reconcile summary vs address aggregates |
| `btc-anchor` | Summary does not declare a BTC block height time anchor |
| `onchain-balance-hot` | No public HotCold wallet address list |
| `onchain-balance-token` | No public wallet address list for ERC20/BEP20 audit |
| `onchain-balance-ledger` | Verifier not available for this exchange snapshot |
| `address-ownership` | No public download channel for wallet ownership signatures / proofs |
| `third-party-attestation` | No public third-party attestation report available |
| `cross-chain-wrapped` | No per-row wrapped-asset metadata in public PoR artifacts (token contract, representation type e.g. WBTC/cbBTC, canonical asset, custody mode) |

### Row-level findings

#### `solvency-claim` (`FAIL`)

Summary: gate summary missing totalReserveRate

## 7. Minimal Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has public PoR been published during the last 12 months? (S0-1) | `pass` | Snapshot 20260801 is in the public evaluation set. |
| Is snapshot time explicit? (S0-2) | `pass` | 2026-08-01T00:00:00Z |
| Is there reserve summary or wallet_address_list? (S0-3) | `pass` | Summary present; wallet_address_list absent. |
| Is wallet_address_list public and on-chain verifiable? (S1-1) | `fail` | No public wallet_address_list artifact. |
| Is wallet_ownership_proof public and batch-verifiable? (S1-2) | `unverifiable` | address-ownership verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| Is global_proof public and independently reproducible? (S1-3) | `unverifiable` | global-zk-proof verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| Is independent third-party review available with stated scope? (S1-4) | `unverifiable` | third-party-attestation verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| If trusted setup is required, is transcript public; otherwise is the proof system transparent setup? (S1-5) | `unverifiable` | No public trusted setup transcript observed for zk-SNARK global proof. |
| Is root/proof/vk canonically anchored outside exchange servers? (S2-1) | `not_applicable` | Stage 2 is not evaluated until Stage 1 blockers are resolved. |
| Is publication frequency sufficient for Stage 2 (weekly full PoR / daily anchor)? (S2-2) | `not_applicable` | Stage 2 is not evaluated until Stage 1 blockers are resolved. |

## 8. Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Related Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P0` | Publish missing public artifacts required for independent reproduction. | `UNVERIFIABLE` |
| `P0` | Publish trusted setup transcript or migrate to a transparent-setup proof system. | `OPAQUE_TRUSTED_SETUP` |

## 9. Boundary

This report evaluates public PoR artifacts and reproducibility. It does not evaluate the exchange's overall financial health, corporate governance, internal controls, off-chain assets, legal compliance, or complete off-balance-sheet liabilities.

Missing data must be marked as `UNVERIFIABLE`, not treated as `PASS`.

## Capture notes / gaps (2026-10-31)

Same public-API capture path as `20261001`; zk zip login-gated; no official totalReserveRate; display rootHash is base64 UI string.
