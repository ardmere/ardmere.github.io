## 5. Verifier Evidence

## 6. Verifier Finding Details

This section explains `FAIL`, `WARN`, and `UNVERIFIABLE` outcomes from the verification bundle. Row-level `UNVERIFIABLE` entries often mean the verifier does not yet support that (coin, network) pair, not that the exchange failed the check. Full machine-readable output: `20260915.verification-bundle.v2.json` in the local artifact bundle.

### Capability and artifact gaps (`UNVERIFIABLE`)

| Verifier | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `user-merkle-proof` | BingX user Merkle proof not present; download leaf/path while logged in, wrap as JSON, import via -user-proof |
| `internal-consistency` | Wallet address bundle not available |
| `btc-anchor` | BTC block time anchor verifier not implemented |
| `onchain-balance-hot` | Wallet address bundle not available for on-chain audit |
| `onchain-balance-token` | Wallet address bundle not available for token audit |
| `onchain-balance-ledger` | Verifier not available for this exchange snapshot |
| `address-ownership` | No public download channel for wallet ownership signatures / proofs |
| `global-zk-proof` | Global proof.csv / verifying key not publicly distributed |
| `third-party-attestation` | No public third-party attestation report available |
| `cross-chain-wrapped` | No per-row wrapped-asset metadata in public PoR artifacts (token contract, representation type e.g. WBTC/cbBTC, canonical asset, custody mode) |

No additional row-level `FAIL` or `WARN` findings beyond the summary table in §5.

## 7. Minimal Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has public PoR been published during the last 12 months? (S0-1) | `pass` | Snapshot 20260915 is in the public evaluation set. |
| Is snapshot time explicit? (S0-2) | `pass` | 2026-09-15T00:00:00Z |
| Is there reserve summary or wallet_address_list? (S0-3) | `pass` | Summary present; wallet_address_list absent. |
| Is wallet_address_list public and on-chain verifiable? (S1-1) | `fail` | No public wallet_address_list artifact. |
| Is wallet_ownership_proof public and batch-verifiable? (S1-2) | `unverifiable` | address-ownership verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| Is global_proof public and independently reproducible? (S1-3) | `unverifiable` | global-zk-proof verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| Is independent third-party review available with stated scope? (S1-4) | `unverifiable` | third-party-attestation verifier UNVERIFIABLE. |
| If trusted setup is required, is transcript public; otherwise is the proof system transparent setup? (S1-5) | `not_applicable` | No global ZK proof in the assessed public artifact set. |
| Is root/proof/vk canonically anchored outside exchange servers? (S2-1) | `not_applicable` | Stage 2 is not evaluated until Stage 1 blockers are resolved. |
| Is publication frequency sufficient for Stage 2 (weekly full PoR / daily anchor)? (S2-2) | `not_applicable` | Stage 2 is not evaluated until Stage 1 blockers are resolved. |

## 8. Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Related Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P0` | Publish missing public artifacts required for independent reproduction. | `UNVERIFIABLE` |

## 9. Boundary

This report evaluates public PoR artifacts and reproducibility. It does not evaluate the exchange's overall financial health, corporate governance, internal controls, off-chain assets, legal compliance, or complete off-balance-sheet liabilities.

Missing data must be marked as `UNVERIFIABLE`, not treated as `PASS`.
